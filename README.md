# Microsoft Band Background Task Sample
This code sample looks at developing a background task for a Windows Phone 8.1 application that gives access to the Microsoft Band.

The sample covers how to connect to the Microsoft Band in the background task and the way to create the background task to run [indefinitley](https://www.bing.com/search?q=define+indefinite&FORM=EDGENN).

This Background task sample takes advantage of the DeviceUseTrigger which allows your application to keep the Band background task running for as long as the OS will allow it. To get better, longer results from the Background task, prompt your users to open the Battery Saver application and turn on the option to *Allow app to run in the background* and also check the box which reads *Allow this app to run in the background even when Battery Saver is on*

Please leave any questions or feedback and I will try to get back in touch as soon as possible. You can also reach out to me on Twitter [@jamesmcroft](http://www.twitter.com/jamesmcroft)
